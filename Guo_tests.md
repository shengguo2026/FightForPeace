# Guo's manual tests

One section per milestone. Run the commands in PowerShell. When you find a problem, tell me the milestone number, the step number and what you saw.

## M7 · Enemies, the Sluice Commander and Stage 1 backgrounds

### Get and start the build

```powershell
cd C:\AI\Claude\FightForPeace
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in the browser (if Vite prints another port, use that one). Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

Optional, the portable build: `pnpm release`, then unzip `release\FightForPeace-0.7.0.zip` in another folder and double-click `start.bat`.

### Keys

Player 1 on a QWERTY keyboard: move W A S D, Attack T, Jump Y, Guard G, Grab and pick up J, Special U, Ultimate H, dash = tap a direction twice. On a German keyboard Jump is Z. In the arenas: Home restarts the arena, End goes back to the Lab, F1 shows or hides the Lab panels.

### Steps

1. Start the game. The Lab looks like in M6 (mill corner, dummies, staff and Handwheel). In the Lab panels there is a new **Arena** panel with Arena, Difficulty, Start.
2. Arena: **Trial: Pressed Recruits**, Difficulty: **Easy**, press **Start**, then press F1 to hide the panels. The dry-fields background appears (sky, village, floor, grass in front). At the top: "Trial: Pressed Recruits · Easy · Wave 1/1 · 2 left". The recruits walk in from the right with a red Health bar each.
3. Walk right: the camera follows you and the background layers move at different speeds (far sky slowest). Fight: only one or two recruits attack at the same time, the others circle. Their attack names appear above them.
4. Bring one recruit low while another still fights: it **flees** off the screen ("flees"). Bring the last one low: it **surrenders** and kneels ("surrenders"). When none are left: "ARENA CLEARED".
5. Press Home: the same arena starts again. F1, Difficulty: **Medium**, Restart: now three recruits. Then **Hard**: they attack more often and guard more.
6. **Trial: Bridge Shield** (bridge background), Medium: the shield blocks hits from the front ("guard"), sometimes perfectly; hit it from behind, or after its guard breaks. With F8 (Defense panel) you see your own defense; the shield's guard shows in its pose.
7. **Trial: Canal Runners** (canal), Medium: runners sidestep and backflip away, slide in low (jump or guard low) and try to get behind you.
8. **Trial: Rope Overseer** (mill, with the M6 weapons and scenery), Medium: the overseer throws a rope ("RESTRAINED", escape with the Grab escape) and drags and flings you. The Workstaff and Handwheel can be picked up as in M6.
9. **Trial: Sling Lookouts** (wide canal), Medium: lookouts keep their distance and sling stones. When a lookout is outside the screen, an orange arrow with "INCOMING" appears at the screen edge and you hear a short beep **before** the stone comes. Guard, Exact Block (G just before it hits) or move out of the lane.
10. **Trial: Black-Iron Enforcer** (courtyard), Easy, Medium and Hard: the Enforcer is slow and strong, its punch goes through light hits ("ARMOR"), Anvil Slam is unblockable (move away). At Hard a recruit joins; when both are near you, "TEAM ATTACK" appears over both and they attack together from two sides.
11. The mixed beats at Easy, Medium and Hard: **Beat 2: Occupied Bridge** (two waves: the second arrives when the first is almost done), **Beat 4: Working Mill**, **Beat 6: Canal Route**, **Beat 7: Gate Courtyard**. At Hard, one courtyard recruit is replaced by the Black-Iron Enforcer.
12. With F1 visible during any arena, the Arena panel shows: "threat x/68 · attackers · projectiles · hard CC", your pressure, and the last decision in words (for example "over the pressure cap" or "not visible (off screen)"). The threat number never goes above the budget.
13. **Beat 8: Sluice Commander**, Easy first: the Sluice plate background (the sluice gate). At the top his Health bar with two white ticks (phase changes) and a blue Resolve bar.
14. Hit him: while Resolve lasts, he only flinches briefly and cannot be launched or grabbed. Empty Resolve: "STAGGER BREAK" (the bar turns yellow and counts down); now full combos and launches work. When it ends he refills Resolve and recovers protected.
15. Bring his Health to the first tick: the bar stops at the tick (extra damage shows light red and is applied in the next phase); "phase change queued", then "phase change": he tears off his coat, you are pushed away, stones in the air vanish. Phase 2: an Iron Gate Handwheel appears on the floor, he picks it up and throws it; two recruits join.
16. Second tick: phase 3 "Open the Sluice". An orange ring appears under the winch on the right with three pips above it. When nobody hits him, he walks to the winch and cranks; each finished crank lights a pip. Hit him during a crank: the crank stops and the pip does not light. After three cranks the floor glows (warning) and a water surge hits everything on the floor.
17. Bring his Health to zero: he surrenders and kneels; "ARENA CLEARED". Let yourself be beaten once: "DEFEATED".
18. Repeat steps 13–17 at Medium and Hard (more pressure, faster decisions, more guarding).
19. Optional, two players: Player 2 joins with Num 4 in an arena and appears next to Player 1; the budget switches to the co-op numbers in the Arena panel.
20. End returns to the Lab, which works as in M6.
